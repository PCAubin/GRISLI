This file explains how to use the precompiled SPAMS library for Matlab.

## Linux users

1. Extract the toolbox:
```
VERSION="2.6"
DA="2017-02-22"
TARGET="Linux"
tar -zxvf spams-Matlab-precompiled-v$VERSION-$DA-$TARGET.tar.gz
```

2. Run Matlab in the extracted directory with the command `start_spams` to
load SPAMS precompiled functions and set a few environment variables:
```
cd spams-matlab-v$VERSION
matlab -r "start_spams"
```
  Or directly run the command `start_spams` in Matlab. A few examples are
  available in the subdirectory [test_release](./test_release).


## MacOS users

In a terminal
1. Extract the toolbox:
```
VERSION="2.6"
DA="2017-02-22"
TARGET="MacOSX-10.9.5"
tar -zxvf spams-matlab-precompiled-v$VERSION-$DA-$TARGET.tar.gz
```

2. Run Matlab in the extracted directory with the command `start_spams` to
load SPAMS precompiled functions and set a few environment variables:
```
cd spams-matlab-v$VERSION
matlab -r "start_spams"
```
  Or directly run the command `start_spams` in Matlab. A few examples are
  available in the subdirectory [test_release](./test_release).
